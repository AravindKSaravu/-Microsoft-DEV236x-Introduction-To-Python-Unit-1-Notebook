Calling a Function:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
----------------
Parameters:
Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
--------------
Passing a List as a Parameter:
You can send any data types of parameter to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

def my_function(food):
  for x in food:
    print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

my_function(fruits)
				-----------
Return Values:
To let a function return a value, use the return statement:

def my_function(x):
  return 5 * x

print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))
				-----------
Recursion:
Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.
Recursion Example 		

def tri_recursion(k):
  if(k>0):
    result = k+tri_recursion(k-1)
    print(result)
  else:
    result = 0
  return result

print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)

--------------------
Escape Sequences:

escape sequences all start with a backslash (\)
escape sequences can be used to display characters in python reserved for formatting
\\   Backslash (\)
\'   Single quote (')
\"   Double quote (")
escape sequences are part of special formatting charcters\n Linefeed
\t   Tab
\n   return or newline
We use escape sequences in strings - usually with print() statements

----------------------

while True:
Using the 'while True:' loop

while True: is known as the forever loop because it ...loops forever

Using the while True: statement results in a loop that continues to run forever
...or, until the loop is interrupted, such as with a break statement
       			-----------------------------------

break:
in a while loop, causes code flow to exit the loop
a conditional can implement break to exit a while True loop
-----------------
Incrementing
votes = votes + 1     or    votes += 1
Decrementing
votes = votes - 1     or   votes -= 1
			--------------------------------


Python len() Function:
The len() function returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.

How do you print quotation marks in Python?:
			-------------------
 
Answer:You can put a backslash character followed by a quote ( \" or \' ).

Example:# [ ] print output that is exactly (with quotes): "That's how we escape!"
->  print("\"That's how we escape\"")
