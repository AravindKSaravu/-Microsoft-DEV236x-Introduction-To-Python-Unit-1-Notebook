Conditionals: Boolean String test methods with if

if student_name.isalpha():
.isalnum()
.isalpha()
.istitle()
.isdigit()
.islower()

Comparison Operators
>
<
>=, <=
==
Assign = vs compare ==
!=
			-------------------------------------


String Comparisons:

Strings can be equal == or unequal !=
Strings can be greater than > or less than <
alphabetically "A" is less than "B"
lower case "a" is greater than upper case "A"

def tq_quiz(statement,t_or_f):
    tf_quesdtion = inpurt("(T/F)"+statement+":")
    if t_or_f.lower() == tf_quedtion.lower():
        return("Correct")
    else:
	return("Incorrect")
quiz_eval = tf_quiz("","T")
print("your answer is :", quiz_eval)

Concept: Conditional elif:
Using the Conditional elif
Review: if and else

if means "if a condition exists then do some task." if is usually followed by else
else means "or else after we have tested if, then do an alternative task"
When there is a need to test for multiple conditions there is elif

elif  statement follows  if, and means "else, if " another condition exists do something else
elif  can be used many times
else  is used after the last test condition (if or elif)
in pseudo code
If it is raining bring an umbrella
or Else If  (elif) it is snowing bring a warm coat
or Else go as usual

Like else, the elif only executes when the previous if conditional is False
